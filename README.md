# üõí  Welcome to **UltimateShop**

> **UltimateShop** is a powerful shop plugin for Spigot!

## üîí No Need to Worry About Custom Item Changes

**UltimateShop** uses **NBT-based item recognition** instead of comparing entire items.  
It fully supports compatibility with plugins like **MMOItems**, **eco**, **ItemsAdder**, **NeigeItems**, **Oraxen**, and **MythicMobs**.

Even if an item is enchanted, renamed with an anvil, or modified by other plugins (like lore changes),  
UltimateShop can still recognize it correctly and allow it to be sold.

You don‚Äôt need commands to give players items.  
UltimateShop‚Äôs built-in item syntax supports all these plugins natively ‚Äî  
just **two lines of configuration** enable buying and selling functionality.

Need to tweak items from other plugins (e.g., change name, replace lore)?  
UltimateShop fully supports modifying items based on plugin-provided templates.

## üß≠ Menu System

UltimateShop includes a fully customizable menu system inspired by **TrMenu** slot configuration.

- Customize item layout for each shop.
- Add custom buttons with actions and conditions.
- Fully configurable menus both inside and outside shops.

## ‚è≥ Item Limits and Cooldowns

UltimateShop allows you to configure:
- Global and personal limits for **buy** and **sell** (4 attributes);
- Global and personal cooldowns for **buy** and **sell** (4 attributes).

That‚Äôs a total of **8 configurable attributes**, usually only found in premium shop plugins!

Reset modes include:
- Daily/weekly/monthly reset;
- Timer-based reset;
- Permanent (no reset);
- Custom reset via placeholders from other plugins.

Personal limits can be conditional ‚Äî for example, VIPs can have higher limits.  
Both personal and global limits support math expressions and PlaceholderAPI variables.  
You can even create a **real-stock system**, where items can only be bought after others sell them, keeping the economy balanced.

Cooldowns ensure players must wait a period after each buy or sell before repeating.

## üí∞ Highly Customizable Prices and Products

Prices and products can both be defined using **items or currency**.  
Supports:
- 10+ economy plugins;

- Discounts and random shops.

With this flexibility, you can:
